# Command line for the win

Screenshots proving I solved the first 27 challenges on https://cmdchallenge.com/

I utilized the SFTP command-line tool to transfer files from my local machine to my sandbox. The process involved the following steps:

* Established SFTP Connection: Copied the SFTP command provided by my sandbox and pasted it into the terminal on my local machine. This initiated an SFTP session and connected my local machine to the sandbox.
* Transferred Files Using 'put' Command: After establishing the connection, I used the 'put' command to transfer the screenshot files from my local machine to the sandbox. I specified the file paths or directory locations as needed.
